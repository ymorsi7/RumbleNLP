1,1,"Have not even watched all of it and I agree completely. Women have forgotten their real strengths, strengths that men do not have. That is the saddest part."
1,2,"I am a woman in the military. I'm a nurse in the Air Force. It's a non combat roll. Even if women can meet the PT standard, I still don't think women should be in combat rolls. It's more about their squad mates. Men in those fields would be more affected by a woman on their team being injured than even their best friend. Those men tend to be traditionally masculine and would be more affected by a woman being injured than a buddy. It would affect morale and performance."
1,3,"Ahoy, Crowderites!!! And I definitely agree that women should not be in combat!!"
1,4,"Agreed! As a woman I know men are stronger than women. Women have periods , cramps every month , and hormones ‚Ä¶ ouch ! I‚Äôm a woman but it‚Äôs true .!"
1,5,"Men engage in combat, hunting, survival. Women tend to the children and the homestead.

Prior to our ‚Äúmodern world‚Äù every other civilization understood this followed their instincts. If the women hunted the group would starve"
1,6,my sister is 11 years older than me and was on the army for 12 years and I'm just a regular guy and she could never beat me in anything much less combat and she was in before they lowered the standards
1,7,"It's all fun and games til it gets physical. Can women be great shots with their weapon? Absolutely! But combat is far more than being a good shot. All those women in superhero movies throwing men around... It's fiction for a reason. No 115 pound woman is going to throw around a 300 pound man. She would just bounce off of him. That's the facts. There is a reason for woman's tees at the gold course, women's PT test has (or at least had when I was in the Army) push-ups on their knees, etc. Finally, if a woman is captured in a war or military op, she is going to be raped. I'm a married man and love my wife. I also have a daughter. I am not anti-woman, just for common sense and protecting the women in my life."
1,8,"the red hair lady when she say's ""ok"" drives me crazy ahhhhhh"
1,9,Told my daughter when she started to express interest in the military that to join (with my blessing) she would have to be strong enough to lift me and carry me the length of a football field. She lost interest very quickly after that.
1,10,I was on active duty in the Infantry when they started this experiment. I have said and still say the same thing except there is no changing my mind about it. as if the battlefield doesn't come with enough stress and unpredictability as it is. feelings are more important.
1,11,Hate to bring this up but not only would a woman in extreme danger in a combat scenario but they would almost be guaranteed to be raped if captured.
1,12,"Retired Army Officer, They where lowering the standards all the way back in the 90s for women. Airborne school for example use to be a serious gut check. But when I went through in 1993 it was a joke.. And the women where always in the front of the run group so we didn't drop them from the formation. The most worthless thing on the battlefield a pregnant female. Not deployable for 9 plus months.. great for readiness."
1,13,Does combat include jello/mud wrestling?
1,14,"One standard, change my mind"
1,15,"Lower standards are ok for every role other than combat. This isn't a game, we are looking for killers plain and simple."
1,16,"All us Gen X girls were taught to bring home the bacon, fry it up in a pan‚Ä¶and wear shoulder pads in our clothes. Regardless, there‚Äôs no fkn way I could carry a wounded man to safety‚Ä¶and he would know it. It‚Äôs not fair to ask our soldiers to put their lives on the line without giving them a fighting chance to survive. Women are not physically strong enough to be in the foxhole with the guys. It‚Äôs not right. Thank you for this. Good God everyone has lost their minds"
1,17,"""ok. ok. ok. ok. ok. ok. ok. ok.""... Jesus, does she know any other words?"
1,18,"I was infantry. I don't care if the PT standards are the same and some butch chick can pass them. A woman in a combat unit adds nothing to the combat readiness of that unit, that some other guy couldn't. She does however bring a great deal of negatives, and it doesn't matter if you don't like or agree. She is a distraction and a detriment to the unit cohesiveness. The job of combat arms is to close with and destroy the enemy by fire and maneuver. Not to coddle your feelings, or make sure some random woman can become a general easier by allowing her combat experience. Troop welfare has always been secondary to mission accomplishment. Get over it."
1,19,"It was my dream to play for the Yankees,doesn‚Äôt mean the Yankees should lower their standards to let me joinüòÇ"
1,20,"lots of ""I think"" and ""I Feel"" but no actual argument. Sorry kids, the worlds not nice"

1,22,Kool-Aid haired black girl was the worst of them all.
1,23,"I can't hear ""ok"" again"
1,24,"I'm a woman, I am physically fit. I cannot manage one five gallon bucket of paint up a flight of stairs without lifting it to each step and then re-setting to struggle it to the next one. My husband can lift the same heavy bucket with one finger and walk straight up the deck stairs. In combat I'd be a liability, no matter how much I worked out. Fighter pilot yes, ground forces, hell no!"
1,25,"""I feel like"" facts don't give a shit about how you feel"
1,26,"As someone who was in the military during the transition of females into combat arms, it made things INCRDIBLY difficult and reduced our capabilities. Disregarding the physical fitness aspect, when deployed having to accommodate the different sleeping, bathroom, showering, and medical needs in itself was highly taxing. You can drop a man off in the woods and leave them for a good amount of time with little needs, but for them ""high maintenance"" was an understatement. And to be clear, it wasnt all about them demanding it but what was mandated."
1,27,They have definitely succeeded in dumbing down the younger generations. They are so uninformed and ignorant to reality. It's all about their feelings.
1,28,"Ok, so Shirley from What‚Äôs Happening with the red hair is hearing Crowder But not listening! She is already getting emotional which proves the biggest difference between men and women! And the men she is referring to that are ‚Äúemotional‚Äùare girly boys!!! And to get upset about calling our military BEASTS, come on!!! That is a good thing!"
1,29,"I want to bring another point to the argument. I‚Äôm a woman who served in Iraq (not in a combat role) and worked with a man who was in a convoy with a female. The enemy found out she was there, and targeted her. The objective was to demoralize the men and unfortunately, it worked. She was taken out and they were weaker because of it. My best friend (female) who served in Iraq went to dinner downtown and someone attempted to kidnap her. She only got away because her driver was special forces, knew the roads and was trained to handle this particular situation. In certain trainings they simulate torture and often separate women, but not fully out of earshot of the men, so they can hear what‚Äôs happening and break their spirits. I would argue it‚Äôs not even enough to match the men physically because women become targets in multiple ways. I‚Äôm not sure what that would look like for a female physically, but there is a mental aspect in war that is put upon men that just isn‚Äôt worth it in my opinion."
1,30,"Lets get ready to Rumble!!!love this. I agree with you, Steven 100%"
1,31,"So it breaks down to the same argument as always... Steven has stats and facts, people who disagree have feelings."
1,32,There is a reason that back in the day only men were in combat roles. We have pussified our country and military in the name of equality and its pathetic we go along with it.
1,33,"I enjoy Crowders ""Change My Mind"" segments. One of my favorite things."
1,34,‚ù§Ô∏èchange my mind
1,35,Woman should be in combat because it makes for great videos. I want to see the red headed black chick try to stop a George Floyd. Welcome to the 2022 clown world.
1,36,Ahoy!!! Ok let's see how many libs complain about this lol.
1,37,"Crowder talks about military and police, but firefighters are another issue. They are required to run up stairs with lots of gear on, break down doors, pick up, and carry people."
1,38,"Black chick was SO frustrating. I wouldn't have been able to maintain a respectful attitude once she said ""You need to do your research then and blah blah"" because this dumb b*tch didn't do a damn bit of research and still kept arguing about how she ""feels"" for like 15 minutes before that point."
1,39,"I am former military. I have many friends that are former, and active. There is a hidden hatred on the special treatment that women get in the branches. That could be why recruitment is low with men? I have had a few people tell me some of the unawarded medal's given to women, just because they are women. Women being sent back to barrack's, while the men stay out in the field, during training mission's. The military spent MANY years building up pride, tradition, valor, and honor. Completing a rigorous training, with your fellow (in my case, shipmates), the teamwork, trust, loyalty, creates something magical. A brotherhood. You need to have that confidence, when in a combat situation. Knowing the females slid in, with lower standards, ruins that. There is no respect. It seems that outside interest's, are manipulating our inner working's of the military, to make us weaker?"
1,40,Where is Hotlips Houlihan
1,41,Commenting as a female Army veteran I agree. What we can do are the support jobs (I was a military journalist) to free up the men for combat. It's hard enough in the military with the female-male dynamic without adding combat to the equation.
1,42,let's go!!
1,43,"My sister was a Police officer for 20 years. She had to pass the exact same physical testing that a man would have, or she was out. Thats the way it should be and unfortunately it isnt anymore"
1,44,"First some of these people go round and round contradicting themselves trying to look like the smartest person at the table. I don't know how Steven doesn't lose it. Second, I was in the military. There is no way women should be in combat or in the elite forces. Not just based on physical strength but also because men have an inherent impulse to protect women at all costs."
1,45,"I was in the military. I retired from it and I have no respect for women in the military. They are smart and capable of many things men can't do. But the ripe the moral and cohesion of every unit they are present including the legal career ending risks of an unsubstantiated accusations that have destroyed hundreds if not thousands of careers of men. Here is one reason among many, women lie. Yes they do and for very selfish reasons. I have seen them gang up on a guy they don't like with lying to get them court martialed out of the service. As well as lying about being pregnant or getting pregnant to get out of a deployment. I was on a ship that had berths for 30 women. We routinely got underway of deployment with only one woman. This doubles and triples the load on the men. We were routinely sleep deprived. We would return to base, the women left at home come back and still got sea pay for staying home. Not fair. In addition, any woman in the room outranks every male nt matter what their rank. They also enlist men and boys to help women do their jobs. They are a distraction to the mission as the point of all missions devolves into protecting the woman. Mission be damned. This is not including the demographic destruction of the population by putting child bearing aged women at risk. Women have one kid at a time. Society needs more women than men to keep thier population. By putting women into an early grave to win a war you lose the demgraphic war, which is the same as losing."
1,46,"Letting someone into a position based on religion, sex, blah blah is the same discrimination as turning someone away. The constitution protects the institution as well as the citizen. An employer does not have to hire you because you are a black gay jewish combat lesbian."
1,47,"Her: ""Im not going to believe anything you say until I see that statistics""

Steven: ""Oooook""

In her mind: O no!"
1,48,The red hair black girl is like so many ppl these days. Doesnt like the statement Steven presented. Unwilling to listen and reason
1,49,"I was in the military, women should have very limited roles in the military. We were deploying to Iraq, walking off the c5 in country and a woman in our company couldn‚Äôt carry her own bags. We were all carrying a ruck sack, a weapon, and 2 duffle bags. She couldn‚Äôt carry her own shit. All her stuff got carried by the guys carrying their own shit. She walked around with her weapon."
1,50,"That second girl, Ploy...my God. She just talked around the fundamental issue - men are bigger, stronger, and faster. No amount of training will overcome that gap. And we haven't even talked about group cohesion. According to studies from the military, all male units accomplish tasks faster than male/female units."
2,51,The problem is.gov programs replacing fathers with zero accountability for destructive female behavior.
2,52,the problem with modern women is 4s think they are 14s and they deserve the top 1% of men instead of a good man
2,53,"Women today do not know what a woman is supposed to be, they are to busy trying to be like men."
2,54,"Media has taught women that they have been steamrolled for years and they must dominate. They honestly feel that they are everything and men should fight to the death just to be in there presence. In short...they are full of themselves and see themselves as an object that all men desire. This of course is a generalization. I know wonderful women that absolutely deserve to be treated like a queen. BUT they are always married, and happily married I might add. Women are like parking spots at Walmart. All the good ones are taken and all that is left is the handicapped."
2,55,Never go to Hawaii with a woman who forgets her bi-polar meds .
2,56,If you think 22-32 can pass quickly----wait until you are 60 and al of a sudden you're 80! A lifetime passes so very quickly it's unimaginable!
2,57,The guest is a feminist as well with her high status requirements. Their isn't enough top 5-10% chads to go around.
2,58,"On Thanksgiving the topic came up at the table why I'm not married yet(40, and very stable), because my mom really wants grandchildren, and it's next to impossible to explain to a table of elders that modern women are just intolerable."
2,59,"On a single sheet of paper, define yourself in two ways: 1) Who do you credibly intend to be as a person? 2) What do you credibly intend to do with your life, in general terms? If you do this well, and live out your life in accord with your personal mission statement, you will have plenty of opportunities with other quality people. Choose wisdom. Choose honor. Choose integrity."
2,60,Modern women have this obsession with dressing like prostitutes. Can't watch a video without seeing these sleazy women wearing their tank tops exposing as much flesh as they can. Modern women have lost any and all feminine beauty! A big part of feminine beauty is modesty which is completely lost on the whores that make up the bulk of our society.
2,61,"The Establishment Media is out to break Humanity any way they can, driving people apart and making us easier to control by a tiny elite class of.... aristocrats. Yes, the same old crap has risen once again. IMHO, it is not Marxism that is the foundation of the Left, it is FEAR. Fear of the people all around them. This is why ordinary people are portrayed as dumb, panicky beasts on TV and in movies. This is why CRT is used to kids fear & despise each other AND feel bad about themselves based on the color of their skin. The Establishment is trying to make us see each other the same way they do; monsters. This insanity only gets worse and louder, and making Women & Men repulsive to each other is one of their oldest tricks. It also discourages reproduction, and this kind of Malthusian evil is so near & dear to Leftists that they just go right along with it. A serious problem is right in our faces, and anyone will be lucky to get through the next 5 years alive."
2,62,jedediah...what is your take on election fraud?
2,63,"The problem with EVERYONE, is that the Media tells them what to think, and they're so lazy, that they consent to mental slavery."
2,64,"Ladies... men ARE masculine but hide it because it's, as you stated, negatively viewed by society."
2,65,Women used to subtlely build their men into greatness but now they often browbeat them into submission! :-(
2,66,"Biden's SEC is corrupt too Does it not seem strange google, Amazon, twitter ... were not bothered by the sec: all woke companies but Elon who owns twitter wanting to make it non woke and trump who has truth social non woke are both under attack from the sec"
2,67,"I think women watch and listen to too much media and don't live in reality, the knight on the White horse with the 6 figure salary ain't coming, especially to 35 and up women with a kid or kids and single men do not want to deal with women's kids and the trip their on. Life is too short, I'm single in my 50s, never been married, I almost was twice and I thank God it never happened! I would of been miserable, all my friends who got married are divorced and I would watch them fall apart and I was like this is not for me. It was the best decision of my life. I'm totally free and it's beautiful and I don't put up with anyone's bullshit, especially women who think they are a 10 on the outside but are a one on the inside."
2,68,"Next episode ""The Problem with Modern Man"" I look forward to seeing how High on the pedestal you put yourself... Humans, You have much to learn, it's embarrassing! Beings from the Billions of other Universes see how dumb carbon units are! UGH! YOUR NOT TRANSCENDING you're transforming.... Men to Women Women into Men & Now Mutilation of the Children! Sick Lot! GREAT! üòñ"
2,69,Their problem is that modern women want to be entitled women with what they think are men's benefits without having to actually earn anything!
2,70,"I don't think that men need to, as you say, ""get in the gym"". I think men just need to be men. And women just need to be women. It's not a competition, just be who you are.

"
2,71,"Wife walks into a lawyers office and says she wants a divorce. Lawyer says, ok here's what you need to do in order to reap the most alimony, and for at least six months. Make him breakfast and dinner every day. Press his clothes. Meet him at the door coming home from work, and cater to his every need and demand being overly attentive. She agrees.

Six months later she went back to the office, lawyer asks if she's ready ~ to which she replied No Way! I would never divorce such a perfect man and I've never been more happy in my life!

There's a moral to this story."
2,72,"Women are losing there virginity for stupid reasons, then being alone in their last 50-60 yrs. They should sell it for 5 million bucks to a guy and possibly marry him and have his children and be happy for her life, but whatever."
2,73,I wouldnt feel bad at all for these ignorant people. if they just sit there and shovel a bunch of garbage into their mind without actually doing their own research they deserve it!
2,74,"Layah, thank you for not wearing fake eyelashes. It brings credibility to you."
2,75,"Problem With Modern Women. Major problem is that in today's society, modern women is that they are lazy and are not dating enough in develop the proper people skills when determining how to find the right man. Instead, they rely on phony characteristics such as wealth, fame, status and power as factors instead of compatibility."
2,76,Who is Andrew Tate? I just can't follow this show. üòï
2,77,"The more I hear them talk, the more I think ""social Darwinism"". Survival of the fittest. The weak be damned. This is a problem in our society on both sides. Hear me out. Both sides traffic in what I have heard called ""blank slate theory"". It basically means, we all start out a blank slate and we can do anything we put our minds to. The world is your oyster. The left's version: We're all a blank slate. So any difference in outcome must AUTOMATICALLY be attributed to externalities. Systems of oppression is the latest one. Regardless, it is NEVER the individual and ALWAYS the externality. The right's version: We're all a blank slate. So any difference in outcomes must AUTOMATICALLY be attributed to the individual. You are lazy. You are weak. You make excuses. You are entitled and spoiled. Mental illness is just an excuse. You weren't (as the guest said) willing or able to ""put in the work"" to be the alpha, confident prototype man they are describing. Never the externalities. ALWAYS the individuals fault except in the rarest of cases like birth defects or severe trauma, illness or injury outside of your control. The problem is they are BOTH RIGHT...SOMETIMES. But it is the times when they are wrong that does damage to people who are either legitimately impaired by mental illness or are actually being legitimately disenfranchised by a person, persons or systems gone wrong. That number grows and grows until you have what we see in society. Chaos. A breakdown of what used to work. Late capitalism the left calls it. Oligarchic, corporatist totalitarian fascism is what say. Not every man OR woman has the capacity to do or be what these two are talking about. And it is almost like they are describing people unworthy of love and companionship because they are ""less than"" or ""unworthy"". Gee, I wonder why some people hate conservatives. Shocking. And yes I could say the EXACT same thing about the left for different reasons. The reason they are hated is well-earned too."
2,78,Body count of 15 or 20 for women??? Don't kid yourselves ... more like 100+ and plenty in their mid-20s; lots of self-admittance online confirming this!
2,79,"Ok, here's some ""steel, sharpening steel"" here. Laylah, you mentioned the importance of not wearing too much makeup, as expressed by your brother -with your agreement. But after hearing you drop the F bomb, so casually, several times during the interview, I turned off said interview. You see, there are many, quality men who may even overlook the application of an excessive amount of makeup, but for whom the nonchalant use of foul language may actually be the real deal breaker."
2,80,These two women have no idea how not traditional they are.
2,81,have to look up Andrew Tate! never heard of him.
2,82,"Women are powerful. Our power comes from our influence. We can make a man get weak at the knees. we can make a man cheat. We can make a man cut his hair as in Samson. We can use our influence to make men better or make them weaker. Today's women want to emasculate men, just like woman with Samson. But we can also use our power to make the world a better place."
2,83,"You women claiming there aren't any good man, 'modern women' are foolishly against men while claiming men should be like Tate (because he's rich and in shape or ""manly""); makes you no better than the modern woman... ""men should learn from Tate""...? really? Tate is a selfish person, granted alpha, but you want that for yourself? more rich men sleeping around with ""16 women""(A. Tate) a week? You're making the same agreement as modern woman with a slight ""pick me"" hint. This is the reason men haven't listen to women since Adam and Eve."
2,84,Layah Heilpern is delightful. Maybe the worm is finally turning. The last few decades have sucked for white men especially.
2,85,male emotions are like female sexuality . what one gender wants from the other but a turn off if to open with them
2,86,what about married women who don't enjoy sex

2,95,Women are equipped to be hoes.
2,96,Repulsive right out of the gate.
2,97,"I personally believe it‚Äôs not just a social demographic issue of brainwashed men. There‚Äôs a lot of reasons that impact a man‚Äôs masculinity. By this, I mean there are also biological factors that effect men physiologically such as chemical infested foods, estrogen in the water, plastics, normalizing low levels of testosterone, pornography, etc. Not only are men targeted psychologically but also biologically as mentioned. People target only the psychological aspect but don‚Äôt look how nutrition can massively influence the state of mind in a person. With all this estrogen rising through foods, self-care products, and household items is not just causing hormonal imbalances but also detrimental results on overall health I.E. fertility, developmental problems, and cancer."

3,134,Freddo is about as masculine as Freddo. Lemon and Anderson? Masculine? More like fairies.
3,135,"""As we say in the female community"" - I laughed so hard at that, I had to pause it! I don't think anyone of us on here is shocked that cnn is a sausage fest.

"
3,136,Nothing like when the Left get their own medicine handed back to them.
3,137,Lemon and Cooper are Men?Could have fooled me.
3,138,as well you should be. mmmhmmmm.
3,139,Best suggestion I have heard EVER!
3,140,Just assuming the gender of those around you is racist. I'll bet a few of them identify as fish. üê°
3,141,"Lol. Nothing new, nothing shocking. Lol! Jeff transitioning? Lol !"
3,142,Cry me a river propaganda wh*re
3,143,"I think a lot of commentors have missed the point. CNN lectures against sexism, but apparently practices it. If all of those men are really these best people for those jobs, fine, but is it not a little suspicious that all of those positions are filled by men given their company's alleged views?"
3,144,Get it Tuck!
3,145,Tucker is a HOOT !!!
3,146,Love watching Tucker.He makes me laugh üòÖ
3,147,üòÇ hilarious ü§£

4,151,The fat 1 said she can take care of herself ü§≠ üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
4,152,It‚Äôs always the ugly girls ü§£
4,153,Some of these people are stupid as hell üò≠üòÇespecially the girls
4,154,"What a bunch of dorks, they can't even express a single decent opinion."
4,155,Looks like woke Brits are as clueless as woke Americans.
4,156,She did great finding all these rejects and exposing their views to the world üî•
4,157,"This is shocking.. everyone just sheep.. I like him, he speaks facts"
4,158,How can humans be this brain dead?? The interviewer literally destroyed them and proved them wrong
4,159,"It's a trend, only beautiful women like Andrew Tate."
4,160,She‚Äôs amazing
4,161,These people's brains look like there about to explode.
4,162,Big fan of Layah. Probs to her for doing this.
4,163,everything andrew had said is true. and tbh it is very easy to lie to a woman. it is easy to get woman to believe in something that isn't true. they're submissive creatures and easier to get them the other side compared to a actual well thinking man.
4,164,That girl is fit
4,165,Edits are üî•
4,166,I started watching some of Andrew's stuff because my 18 yr old daughter was telling me what a misogynistic guy he was. i watched some of his videos in full because of this. I thought a lot of his view points were good. I love being married to a strong masculine man who protects our family. I like that Andrew is encouraging the masculine in young men again. we need our strong men to keep our countries strong. I don't listen to him a lot because I'm not his target market not interested in fast cars and hot chicks haha. he's doing a great job
4,167,How is that fat whale running away from a knife???????????
4,168,always the 10s defending tate
4,169,"That chick was saying run as fast as you can, she hasn't ran in 15 years üòÇ.

Tate brothersü´°, mad love and appreciation."
4,170,"The 350 lbs girl says no man will own her, what man even wants to talk to you in the first place?"
4,171,fat people talking about taking care of themselves is so funny
4,172,No one wants the first hippo on the left‚Ä¶ big bitch
4,173,"I hope rumble takes over youtube, it‚Äôs already better"
4,174,"Forgive me god for saying this: ""Of course she doesn't like Andrew Tate.. she's fat af..."""
4,175,All these ugly ass women don‚Äôt like Tate. Figures.
4,176,‚ÄúI can take care of myself thank you very much‚Äù Except for your body you fat bitch
4,177,That fat thing at the start will never find anyone of any kind of respect
4,178,I mean just look at that fat 300lb silverback gorilla feminist üòÇ clearly can‚Äôt take care of herself
4,179,"That don't like him because that is what they were told to do. Just like the Germans disliked Jews in the 30s, they were told Jews were bad so that is what they thought."
4,180,"Bruh that fat bitch is so angry, she's probably hungry for some Kfc"
4,181,"The fatty who ""can take care of herself"" is what's wrong with society... She needs to take care a gym membership üòÇ"
4,182,I'm gay and the gay people in these videos are fags
4,183,Interesting twist with a woman asking the questions üôÉ
4,184,I used to be a dumb ass like those girls and then I realized how my mom was treated. Never worked and took care of the house. Satisfied my dad. I don‚Äôt know where I got these ideas of feminism but I guess it was my generation. I started listening to Andrew Tate and my relationship improve. I stay home cook clean service my man and he provides and protects. What a big lie feminism is. I‚Äôm more than happyÔøº and so is my man. Our relationship has never been better and I will show my future son Andrew Tate
4,185,Have you noticed it‚Äôs all the weird fat looking ones that hate Tate. ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
4,186,"This obese lady said if someone pull's a knife on her, she's going to run.. Good luck with that"

4,188,Twitter people
4,189,"If they've got coloured hair, run."

5,201,"If they don't strip naked, I don't care."
5,202,"Well at least the Italian govt isn't arresting their protest leaders and freezing all bank accounts associated with their fundraising efforts, like Canada did to their protesting truckers in Ottawa."
5,203,"I bet if Soros was taken out, most of this stupid nonsense would stop"
5,204,"Just one of the many distractions from what is really happening in Europe. It's falling apart, attacked ruthlessly by the US and blamed on Russia. You just can't write this stuff."
5,205,They take themselves seriously?
5,206,maybe instead of dressing like dolls/psuedo-nude they should dress like ladies
5,207,This is one of many us/Israeli sponsored debauchery shit shows to foment unrest.
5,208,"""gender violence""? wtf are they talking about; to their credit they're not butt naked with 10 lbs. of body hair hanging off of em; the woke mind virus infecting western countries all over the world"
5,209,Lol what is gender violence anyway. I suppose it's a good distraction from the real problems going on in Europe.
5,210,bunch of crazys
5,211,The million dollar question is why are women attracted to the bad boys? Women need to be more honest with themselves.
5,212,Those are some fine daughters they've been raising in Europe. üòï
5,213,Feminism destroyed the family.
5,214,"stop violence against women? thats possible in their brains? lol ok well stop violence against men too, thanks. hopefully your utopia is only a couple more protests away.
mine is when Jesus comes back"
5,215,"They look possessed by Satan. They're protesting their own kind beating them?. Such hypocrisy on the left wing nutjobs. It's not conservatives beating you up, we just wanna work and enjoy life. These mentally challenged individuals are under CIA Mind Control."
5,216,"How stupid!!! It amazes me how foolish women still are, I just can't get over it, we're going backwards....."
5,217,It looks like that show naked and afraidüòÇ

5,219,People of the world who haven't lost their minds we're going to have to make a new country for ourselves and leave this insanity to consume itself
5,220,Fighting the Patriarchy one hairy armpit at a time
5,221,Is this a Broadway audition?
5,222,Someone ought to spank those girls.
5,223,"where is the violence against women in Rome coming from ??? that would be a good precursor to this video , theres nothing like knowing whats going on here RT"
5,224,"Angry Mob against violence sure, I doubt this bunch are victims of anything other than the propaganda of division and hatred. Aggression of any kind is unacceptable in a civilized society and it's only with Love, Light and Truth that a United Society can overcome the obstacles of EVIL. I will note though, Semi naked women dancing around is more of a fertility ritual than a protest."
5,225,Once again another group of psychopath liberals that have lost their mind

5,237,Do they realise they looklike a group of monkeys ????
5,238,if only they had a father to smack em right
5,239,"If you need to get naked to make a point and send a message out, you are doing it all wrong"
5,240,What do you tell a woman with two black eyes? NOTHING ....you've told her twice already!
5,241,"Angry Mob against violence sure, I doubt this bunch are victims of anything other than the propaganda of division and hatred.

5,243,"So effective - I was raised to never hit a woman but watching this really does a great job of promoting gender violence; if I was there in person Id probably act instinctively out of self defence. I wonder if any of these middle class art students have heard of the law, legislation and the political process.... Because this is not how the suffragettes did it for a reason. They werent allowed to be part of the political process so thery needed to be taken seriously. This is the exact opposite because you are not them. You are tools of the state to sow unnecessary division."
5,244,"Gentleman, be careful, these crazy bitches are most likely single and sooner or later will be looking for a man!"
5,245,Feminists don't give a crap about women rights or they would kick trannies and muslims out
5,246,"Of course! Clearly, the muggers, rapists, wife-beaters, etc, of Italy will mend their ways when they finally get the message that women don't like being assaulted. ""D'oh!"" lol"
5,247,They need a good gang raping.
5,248,"Cause in most cases, the bad boys have the money they've ripped of others or gained it by bullying. Females think they can control said bad boy and help them spend the ill gotten loot. But too late, realise they married a bully who doesn't think anything of belting them around. They stick around cause they wish to hang onto the lifestyle they're accustomed too, still believing they can change them. Takes a few years before they realise, they can't change them, by then the damage has been done."
5,249,"Because you shud Meet Him, He Loves Me Really!"
5,250,They look better covered up.
