# RumbleNLP

## About

This is my first NLP project. What follows is my initial thoughts on my approach.

- NLP can be used to automatically analyze and structure text (quickly and cost-effectively).
- We’ll utilize “web-crawling” (Python) to collect data from Rumble (a site known for its allowance of “canceled” individuals to speak freely).
- Using Tf-Idf vectorization (an NLP technique), we’ll extract keywords that are classified as hate speech.
- Using logistic regression, we will train a model to classify hate speech using data extracted from the site.
