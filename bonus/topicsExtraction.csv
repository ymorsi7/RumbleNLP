"I am former military. I have many friends that are former, and active. There is a hidden hatred on the special treatment that women get in the branches. That could be why recruitment is low with men? I have had a few people tell me some of the unawarded medal's given to women, just because they are women. Women being sent back to barrack's, while the men stay out in the field, during training mission's. The military spent MANY years building up pride, tradition, valor, and honor. Completing a rigorous training, with your fellow (in my case, shipmates), the teamwork, trust, loyalty, creates something magical. A brotherhood. You need to have that confidence, when in a combat situation. Knowing the females slid in, with lower standards, ruins that. There is no respect.

But the ripe the moral and cohesion of every unit they are present including the legal career ending risks of an unsubstantiated accusations that have destroyed hundreds if not thousands of careers of men. Here is one reason among many, women lie. Yes they do and for very selfish reasons. I have seen them gang up on a guy they don't like with lying to get them court martialed out of the service. As well as lying about being pregnant or getting pregnant to get out of a deployment. I was on a ship that had berths for 30 women. We routinely got underway of deployment with only one woman. This doubles and triples the load on the men. We were routinely sleep deprived. We would return to base, the women left at home come back and still got sea pay for staying home. Not fair. In addition, any woman in the room outranks every male nt matter what their rank. They also enlist men and boys to help women do their jobs. They are a distraction to the mission as the point of all missions devolves into protecting the woman. Mission be damned. This is not including the demographic destruction of the population by putting child bearing aged women at risk. Women have one kid at a time. Society needs more women than men to keep thier population.
