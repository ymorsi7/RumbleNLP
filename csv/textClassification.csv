my sister is 11 years older than me and was on the army for 12 years and I'm just a regular guy and she could never beat me in anything much less combat and she was in before they lowered the standards,14024000,social issue - people,1,0.075208314
"It's all fun and games til it gets physical. Can women be great shots with their weapon? Absolutely! But combat is far more than being a good shot. All those women in superhero movies throwing men around... It's fiction for a reason. No 115 pound woman is going to throw around a 300 pound man. She would just bounce off of him. That's the facts. There is a reason for woman's tees at the gold course, women's PT test has (or at least had when I was in the Army) push-ups on their knees, etc. Finally, if a woman is captured in a war or military op, she is going to be raped.

"I was infantry. I don't care if the PT standards are the same and some butch chick can pass them. A woman in a combat unit adds nothing to the combat readiness of that unit, that some other guy couldn't. She does however bring a great deal of negatives, and it doesn't matter if you don't like or agree. She is a distraction and a detriment to the unit cohesiveness. The job of combat arms is to close with and destroy the enemy by fire and maneuver. Not to coddle your feelings, or make sure some random woman can become a general easier by allowing her combat experience. Troop welfare has always been secondary to mission accomplishment.

"I want to bring another point to the argument. I‚Äôm a woman who served in Iraq (not in a combat role) and worked with a man who was in a convoy with a female. The enemy found out she was there, and targeted her. The objective was to demoralize the men and unfortunately, it worked. She was taken out and they were weaker because of it. My best friend (female) who served in Iraq went to dinner downtown and someone attempted to kidnap her. She only got away because her driver was special forces, knew the roads and was trained to handle this particular situation. In certain trainings they simulate torture and often separate women, but not fully out of earshot of the men, so they can hear what‚Äôs happening and break their spirits. I would argue it‚Äôs not even enough to match the men physically because women become targets in multiple ways. I‚Äôm not sure what that would look like for a female physically, but there is a mental aspect in war that is put upon men that just isn‚Äôt worth it in my opinion.",16009000,"unrest, conflicts and war - war",1,0.22392274

Here is one reason among many, women lie. Yes they do and for very selfish reasons. I have seen them gang up on a guy they don't like with lying to get them court martialed out of the service. As well as lying about being pregnant or getting pregnant to get out of a deployment. I was on a ship that had berths for 30 women. We routinely got underway of deployment with only one woman. This doubles and triples the load on the men. We were routinely sleep deprived. We would return to base, the women left at home come back and still got sea pay for staying home. Not fair. In addition, any woman in the room outranks every male nt matter what their rank. They also enlist men and boys to help women do their jobs. They are a distraction to the mission as the point of all missions devolves into protecting the woman. Mission be damned. This is not including the demographic destruction of the population by putting child bearing aged women at risk. Women have one kid at a time.
